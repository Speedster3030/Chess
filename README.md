an attemp at a chess "engine" in Java.
very slow move gen and dubious search function,
building this project taught me about object 
oruented programming, and improving on this taught me a lot about 
proper optimization and writing good code.
This is way beyond repair though, but i have kept
this in order to remind myself the importance 
of gradual improvement and progress
