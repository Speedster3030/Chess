My first attemp at a chess engine in Java.

The code is obviously not up to the Professional
Standard, but I'll defend myself by saying that this 
is the first Object Oriented Program I ever made,
and it taught me the basics of how a game program
must be written.

Any corrections and optimizations (if someone out there 
is brave enough) are welcome!
